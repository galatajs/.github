### Motivation

There are many frameworks for NodeJS. So why am I developing `istanbul` instead of using these packages?

Because no frameworks provides 100% support in all areas. One is good at Rest development while one is good at websocket. My aim with `istanbul` is to provide full support whether you develop a cli with nodejs, develop a microservice application, or develop a chat and bank application.  

### Features

- The Progressive Framework.
> flexible and progressive, will support whatever time demands.

- As you need.
> Do you need http? Install the http package. I do not increase the size of your project with unnecessary packages! This may seem like an exaggeration to some people, what about a few kilobytes? I recommend developers who make this defense to develop a multi application on Docker.
